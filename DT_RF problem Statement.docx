Problem Statements:

1.	A cloth manufacturing company is interested to know about the different attributes contributing to high sales. Build a decision tree & random forest model with Sales as target variable (first convert it into categorical variable).


 

2.	 Divide the diabetes data into train and test datasets and build a Random Forest and Decision Tree model with Outcome as the output variable. 





 

3.	Build a Decision Tree & Random Forest model on the fraud data. Treat those who have taxable_income <= 30000 as Risky and others as Good (discretize the taxable income column).





 

4.	In the recruitment domain, HR faces the challenge of predicting if the candidate is faking their salary or not. For example, a candidate claims to have 5 years of experience and earns 70,000 per month working as a regional manager. The candidate expects more money than his previous CTC. We need a way to verify their claims (is 70,000 a month working as a regional manager with an experience of 5 years a genuine claim or does he/she make less than that?) Build a Decision Tree and Random Forest model with monthly income as the target variable.
